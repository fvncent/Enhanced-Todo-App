# Enhanced Todo App v1.0

A learning project to understand React.js core concepts through building a modern, feature-rich todo application. This project serves as a hands-on way to learn React.js fundamentals while creating something practical and extensible.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I'm learning:

- **React Components**: Understanding the building blocks of React applications
- **JSX Syntax**: Learning how JSX works and simplifies component writing
- **State Management**: Understanding React's useState and state management patterns
- **Props & Data Flow**: Learning how data flows between components
- **Effect Hooks**: Using useEffect for side effects like localStorage
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions and form submissions
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying content based on state and conditions
- **Component Lifecycle**: Understanding how components update and re-render

## Features (v1.0)
